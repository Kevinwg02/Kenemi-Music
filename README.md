# Kenemi-Music

I was sick and tired of seeing every single music app with ads... So I made mine using Material3. 

This is very early stages but here is a list of the functionality present: 
Founding audio files
Action on the song (Play, Pause, Next, Previous, loop, loop all)
Tab for player, tracks, albums, artist and playlist. 
Small player in the notification area for quick action.

If you wish to help me out, i will gladly accept any contribution.
