<h1>Kenemi-Music</h1>

<h2>Summary (EN)</h2>
<p>
KenemiMusic is a modern, smooth and fully offline audio player.  
It automatically scans music files stored on the device and organizes your library into songs, albums,
artists, playlists and folders. The app is completely ad-free and collects no data.
</p>

<p>
I was honestly tired of seeing every Android music player packed with ads…  
So I built my own, using Material3 and Jetpack Compose.
</p>

<p>
The project is still in early development, but here’s what’s already available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic audio file detection</li>
  <li>Playback actions: play, pause, next, previous, loop one, loop all</li>
  <li>Dedicated tabs: player, tracks, albums, artists, playlists, folders</li>
  <li>Mini-player in the notification for quick control</li>
</ul>

<p>
The UI is built with Jetpack Compose for a fast and consistent experience across all devices.  
The player runs in the background thanks to a dedicated <strong>MusicService</strong> with full notification control support.
If you'd like to help, contributions are warmly welcome.
